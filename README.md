# convert-yolov4-tiny-to-OAK-one-blob
Colab for converting an existing yolov4-tiny model with weights and cfg to get a blob for the OAK-one

This colab is mostly based on yolo4v-tiny: https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks#tiny-yolov4-object-detector-training-

I divided this excellent colab into two devisions to seperate training from converting.

# this is the converting part
